the AUTH folder is just the authentication using email, phone and google

the realtime folder is a sample of the profile page we are going to create

Till now I have done them separately and not connected them yet. So they are just two separate operations performing on a same firebase project

THE DOUBT: how to connect the uid of the authenticated user to the realtime database to retrieve the data of a particular user


Another drawback of authentication is, since I have put three providers in which email and phone are mandatory, when the submit button is clicked two accounts are created for a single user in the database

Edited code: In the code that is  edited, I am getting an error like user is null when I get redirected to the profile page
