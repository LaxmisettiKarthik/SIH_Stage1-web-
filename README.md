the AUTH folder is just the authentication using email, phone and google

the realtime folder is a sample of the profile page we are going to create

Till now I have done them separately and not connected them yet. So they are just two separate operations performing on a same project

THE DOUBT: how to connect the uid of the authenticated user to the realtime database to retrieve the data of a particular user
